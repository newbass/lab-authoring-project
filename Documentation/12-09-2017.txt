==> Make a basic library of all equipments

==> Implement an experiment from Vlabs using these equipments. Hardcoding this experiment can work too. More functionality can be added later.

==> For better understanding we can refer PhET and try and simulate one of their experiments which explain a concept which is already being explained in one of existing Vlabs experiments.

==> Meet daily with client to get feedback on progress.
