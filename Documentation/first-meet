Our first meet with our mentor Sir Lalit was nice. He explained us oue project which included the following points:
->Make simulations on the physical chemistry projetcs which are available in VLead labs at IIIT-H.
->We were asked to refer some sites namely:
	->phet.com
	->vlabs.iiit.ac.in
He guided us on managing our time towards the project o as to cope ith other subjects as well.As far as the project is concerned we are given the task to make simulations in the field of Physical Chemistry using an open source software.
