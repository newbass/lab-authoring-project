DATE: August 8, 2017
TIME: 1600hrs

Our first meet with our mentor Sir Lalit was quite explanatory. He explained us our project which included the following points:
==> Make simulations on the Physical Chemistry projects which are available in VLead Labs at IIIT-Hyderabad.
	The simulations are provided in flash, and we are supposed to make them work in JavaScript.
==> We were asked to refer to some sites namely:
	==> https://phet.colorado.edu/
	==> https://vlabs.iiit.ac.in/
He guided us on managing our time towards the project as how to cope with other subjects as well.
As far as the project is concerned we are given the task to make simulations in the field of 
Physical Chemistry using an open source software.
