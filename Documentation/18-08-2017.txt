Time: 1715hrs

==> Failing to work for the given hours last week, we were assigned to go through the Chemical Sciences experiments of IIIT Hyderabad which were around 7
including mass spectroscopy,etc.

==> Go through the Phet simulations.

==> Go through the documentation of one of the labs given in the link provided in the email.

==> One out of all the given labs are to be selected and each of them contains around 9 experiments.

==> To get used to the basics of simulating work, we have to build a division in which the left part has the library/pool of all the equipments available in a standard
chemistry lab like pipette, flask, etc.

==> Write what has been done by each individual in a week note.

==> Build a monthly/half-monthly plan for goals and task to be accomplished.

==> Learn the languages that can be useful and build up all the resources required.

Division of work to be decided for the week!
Cheers...
